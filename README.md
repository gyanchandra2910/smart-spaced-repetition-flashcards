## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Using the Web App)
1. Visit [https://gyanchandra2910.github.io/smart-spaced-repetition-flashcards/](https://gyanchandra2910.github.io/smart-spaced-repetition-flashcards/)
2. Create your first flashcard by clicking "Add Card"
3. Start studying with the "Study" button
4. Mark cards as "Known" or "Don't Know" to optimize your learning schedule

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space` or `Enter`: Flip card
- `‚Üí` Arrow Right: Mark as known
- `‚Üê` Arrow Left: Mark as unknown

### Installation (For Developers)

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

3. Start the development server

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Usage

1. **Add Flashcards**: Navigate to the Dashboard and create new cards
2. **Study**: Go to the Study page to review cards due for review
3. **Track Progress**: View your stats in the Dashboard
4. **Export Regularly**: Backup your data using the Export function

### Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability:

This runs unit tests for components, hooks, and utility functions using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The app uses a modified version of the SM-2 algorithm, similar to what's used in Anki:

1. Each card has an "ease factor" starting at 2.5
2. If you know a card, its interval increases by its ease factor
3. If you don't know a card, it's reset to be reviewed again soon
4. The ease factor increases slightly for correct answers and decreases for incorrect ones

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

This application can be installed on your device as a PWA:

1. Visit the app in Chrome, Edge, or other modern browsers
2. Look for the install icon in your address bar
3. Click "Install" to add it to your home screen
